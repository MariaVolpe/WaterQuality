            <h2>Do You Know What's In Your Water?</h>
            <p>
            Everyone knows about water pollution in NYC. But did you know the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) tests bodies of water near you for dangerous levels of bacteria?
            </p>
            <p>
            The DEP records the Enterococcus bacteria weekly in multiple locations in all boroughs of NYC, and releases the information as a spreadsheet that can be found on their website.
            However, education about water pollution is not well known, which creates a safety risk. Do you know where it's safe to swim? How about <b>when</b>?
            </p>
            <h3>What causes water pollution?</h>
            <p>
            NYC has a combined system, where raw sewage and rainwater are collected together in the same pipes. When it rains, the pipes overflow and raw sewage is dumped into bodies of water.
            This Combined Sewage Overflow (CSO) is what pollutes water with Enterococci, bacteria found in human feces. When people come into contact with that bacteria, they can become sick with ear, eye, and skin infections or gastrointestinal issues.
            </p>
            <h3>When is it safe to swim?</h>
            <p>
            CSO is expelled when it rains, so on a wet, rainy day, you are more at risk of becoming sick if you go swimming.

            <h3>Where is it safe to swim?</h>
            <p>
            Some bodies of water are safer than others. Bodies of water that are located far away from sewage pipes are cleaner overall. Unfortunately, lower income neighborhoods are often positioned nearest unclean water.
